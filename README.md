# data_structure_and_algorithm

The start of the structure and algorithm was through the academic curriculum. However, I have continuously developed previous code with both JAVA and PYTHON.

The Source file consists of iteration, a hash function for the login system, and tree implementation.

1. Iteration </br>
    It has 3 different structures as questions are required. Within the given condition, make
    1) minimum big-O,
    2) 2) O(n),
    3) O(1) structures.
    
3. Hash function</br>
    According to the given condition of the question, I have come up with a function to avoid collision as much as possible and increase space efficiency.
    
4. Tree implementation</br>
    Through the terms and conditions given, come up with a tree implementation algorithm to set priority and output.

***Important***
However, this is not a full code. Therefore, it won't be able to run.
In order to run this code, there need to be further sources, that I did not include.
