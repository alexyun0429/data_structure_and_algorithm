# data_structure_and_algorithm

The start of the algorithm and structure was through university study. However, I have continuously developed previous code to then.

The Source file consist of iteration, hash function for login system, and tree implementation.

1. Iteration
    It has 3 different structure as questions required. Within the given condition make 1) minimum big-O, 2) O(n), and 3) O(1) structures.
    
2. Hash function
    According to given condition of question, I have came up with the function to avoid collision as much as possible and increase space efficiency.
    
3. Tree implementation
    Through the terms and conditions given, come up with tree implementation algorithm to set priority and output.
