# data_structure_and_algorithm

The start of the structure and algorithm was through academic curriculum. However, I have continuously developed previous code to then.

The Source file consist of iteration, hash function for login system, and tree implementation.

1. Iteration </br>
    It has 3 different structure as questions required. Within the given condition make 1) minimum big-O, 2) O(n), and 3) O(1) structures.
    
2. Hash function</br>
    According to given condition of question, I have came up with the function to avoid collision as much as possible and increase space efficiency.
    
3. Tree implementation</br>
    Through the terms and conditions given, come up with tree implementation algorithm to set priority and output.

***Important***
However, this is not a full code. Therefore, it won't be able to run.
Inorder to run this code, there need to be further sources. that I did not upload.
